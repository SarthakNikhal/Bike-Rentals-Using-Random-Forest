# Bike Rental Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the total number of bike rentals based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, season, and holidays. This information can be valuable for bike rental companies to optimize operations, meet customer demand, and improve overall efficiency.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the "Bike Sharing Dataset" which contains hourly bike rental information along with weather and seasonal data. The dataset is available on UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle.

**Dataset Features:**

- **datetime:** Date and hour of the record.
- **season:** 1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter.
- **yr:** 0 = 2011, 1 = 2012.
- **mnth:** Month (1 to 12).
- **hr:** Hour (0 to 23).
- **holiday:** Whether the day is considered a holiday.
- **weekday:** Day of the week.
- **workingday:** Whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday.
- **weathersit:** 
    - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
    - 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
    - 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
    - 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
- **temp:** Normalized temperature in Celsius.
- **atemp:** Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius.
- **hum:** Normalized humidity.
- **windspeed:** Normalized wind speed.
- **casual:** Number of casual users.
- **registered:** Number of registered users.
- **cnt:** Total number of bike rentals (casual + registered).

## Model Development

The project explores different machine learning algorithms for prediction:

1. **Linear Regression:** Initially used but resulted in a high error rate.
2. **Decision Tree:** Showed significant improvement but had overfitting issues.
3. **Random Forest:** Achieved the best performance with lower errors and addressed overfitting.

## Results and Evaluation

The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting bike rentals. The model's performance was evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.

## Potential Applications

- **Real-time predictions:** Optimize bike allocation and station stocking.
- **Dynamic pricing:** Adjust prices based on demand fluctuations.
- **Resource optimization:** Improve staff scheduling and maintenance planning.
- **Infrastructure planning:** Guide new station placement and expansion.
- **Marketing and promotion:** Target campaigns effectively.
- **Integration with other services:** Enhance transportation options for users.

## Future Steps

- **Feature engineering and selection:** Explore new and impactful features.
- **Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization:** Improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Exploring other algorithms:** Experiment with GBMs, Neural Networks, and time series models.
- **Real-time prediction and deployment:** Make predictions instantly accessible.
- **User interface and visualization:** Enhance user interaction and data understanding.
- **Collaboration and sharing:** Partner with bike rental companies and open-source the project.
